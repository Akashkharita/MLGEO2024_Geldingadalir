# Tremor Clustering in Iceland's 2021 Geldingadalir Eruption

Welcome to our project repository for the analysis of seismic tremor signals from the 2021 Geldingadalir eruption in Iceland. Using unsupervised machine learning, we aim to uncover hidden patterns in continuous seismic data to enhance understanding of volcanic activity.

## Project Overview

In this project, we replicate and expand upon the findings from the paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-01166-w">Tremor clustering reveals pre-eruptive signals and evolution of the 2021 Geldingadalir eruption of the Fagradalsfjall Fires, Iceland</a>. The paper demonstrates the use of machine learning to analyze tremor signals and detect pre-eruptive activity.

We apply Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC), an unsupervised machine learning technique, to seismic data collected during the eruption. DEC allows us to automatically detect various eruption phases by clustering the continuous tremor signals. Notably, this analysis led to the identification of a previously unknown eruption phase by the authors, highlighting the potential for unsupervised learning in volcanic monitoring.

## Key Goals

- Understand and reproduce the results from our analysis of the 2021 Geldingadalir eruption.
- Expand the application of DEC to new seismic datasets from different volcanic events.
- Explore the potential for real-time monitoring of volcanic activity using similar techniques.

## Our Process

- Step through the code: We will carefully review the workflow to ensure full comprehension of the methods and results.
- Reproduce results: We will run the provided code to verify that the clustering and phase identification techniques produce consistent results.
- Apply to new data: Once verified, we will test DEC on new seismic datasets to uncover additional insights.
- Investigate real-time potential: Ultimately, we aim to explore the possibility of implementing these methods for real-time seismic event monitoring, using insights from the original paper.
