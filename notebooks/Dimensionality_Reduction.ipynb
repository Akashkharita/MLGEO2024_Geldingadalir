    "- Discuss the current dimensions of the dataset and any challenges they present (e.g., high dimensionality, sparse data).\n",
    "- Propose and implement at least two dimensionality reduction techniques:\n",
    "  - Feature extraction techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis).\n",
    "  - Non-linear methods like t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding).\n",
    "  - Visualize the results of dimensionality reduction (scatter plots, explained variance charts).\n",
    "- Discuss the implications of dimensionality reduction on your dataset.\n",
